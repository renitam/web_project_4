# Project 5: Around The U.S.

### Overview
This project will be a practice exercise in basic JavaScript concepts like query selectors & event listeners. We will also be taking our first shot at styling form elements reviewed in Sprint 2.

This is an expansion of project 4 boasting more in-depth JavaScript functionality.
Namely: classList, clone, add/remove/toggle, evt, loops, conditions, arrays and more DOM skills.
