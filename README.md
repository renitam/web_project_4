# Project 9: Around The U.S.

### Overview

In this project, we'll be focusing on asynchronous programming, and APIs. All the content from projects 4-8 has been refactored to send and receive data from the API instead of internal code and utilizes node.js.

The prior project was a practice exercise in basic JavaScript concepts like form validation and DOM manipulation. Additional files have been created and the main functionality of the code have been divided into two classes: Card.js and FormValidator.js. We've also touched upon object destructuring, classes, encapsulation and webpacks.

That project was an expansion of projects 4 & 5 boasting more in-depth JavaScript functionality.
Namely: form validation, classList, clone, add/remove/toggle, evt, loops, conditions, arrays and more DOM skills.
