# Project 8: Around The U.S.

### Overview

This project is a reorganization of the prior project, exploring more defined classes and Webpack plugins.

The prior project was a practice exercise in basic JavaScript concepts like form validation and DOM manipulation. Additional files have been created and the main functionality of the code have been divided into two classes: Card.js and FormValidator.js.

That project was an expansion of projects 4 & 5 boasting more in-depth JavaScript functionality.
Namely: form validation, classList, clone, add/remove/toggle, evt, loops, conditions, arrays and more DOM skills.
